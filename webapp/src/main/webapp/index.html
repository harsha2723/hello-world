    <h1>Welcome to Terawe Technologies! <br>
        <span class="highlight-names">Amal, Ashwin, Krishna Priya, Nizma, Samyukth, Sara, Surya</span>
    </h1>
    
    <p>Hello <span class="highlight">Amal</span>, Ashwin, Krishna Priya, Nizma, Samyukth, Sara, and Surya,</p>

    <p>
        I’d like to extend a warm welcome to all of you as we embark on this exciting journey together at Terawe Technologies. Wishing each of you the very best as we move forward.
    </p>

    <p>Here are my personal observations about each of you—please don’t mind if I get anything wrong!</p>

    <!-- Amal Section -->
    <h2 id="amal-section">Amal</h2>
    <p>
        Amal, you remind me of when I first started my career—quiet, innocent, and introverted, not speaking much to others. But you have one of the purest and simplest souls I’ve encountered. Trust me, things will become even more enjoyable as you start to express yourself more. Wishing you all the best!
    </p>

    <!-- Ashwin Section -->
    <h2 id="ashwin-section">Ashwin</h2>
    <p>
        Hello Ashwin, you resemble one of my cousins, but what stands out most is your thirst for knowledge. You’re never satisfied until you fully understand something, and that’s a rare and admirable quality. Keep that curiosity alive, and best of luck to you.
    </p>

    <!-- Krishna Priya Section -->
    <h2 id="krishna-section">Krishna Priya</h2>
    <p>
        Hi Krishna Priya, I’ve taught many students over the years, but you stand out as one of the best. The way you articulate and explain concepts with conviction is impressive. Keep up that passion for learning—it will take you far.
    </p>

    <!-- Nizma Section -->
    <h2 id="nizma-section">Nizma</h2>
    <p>
        Nizma, you’re one of the strongest individuals I’ve met, both mentally and emotionally. Even when others didn’t believe in us, you believed in yourself, and that determination led to success. I admire the initiative you’ve shown—keep it up and continue to do well.
    </p>

    <!-- Samyukth Section -->
    <h2 id="samyukth-section">Samyukth</h2>
    <p>
        Hey Samyukth, I’m not sure why we’ve grown so close, but maybe it’s because you always listen so attentively! I really appreciate the respect you show others; it’s a unique and admirable trait. We miss you here and hope to see you again soon.
    </p>

    <!-- Sara Section -->
    <h2 id="sara-section">Sara</h2>
    <p>
        Hello Sara, you are the perfect student when it comes to learning. Like Krishna Priya, you explain concepts with such confidence and clarity. Keep that up, and I have no doubt you’ll reach great heights in your career.
    </p>

    <!-- Surya Section -->
    <h2 id="surya-section">Surya</h2>
    <p>
        Vanakkam Surya! I love your eagerness to learn new technologies and grow in your career. The fact that you take detailed notes on what you learn shows how dedicated you are. All the best in your journey ahead!
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
        Finally, remember to always believe in yourself and live in the moment. Good luck to each and every one of you!
